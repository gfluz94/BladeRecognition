# CigaRecognition
This project aims to build an object identification algorithm, based on YOLOv3 in DarkNet framework, which is able to identify cigarettes and cigars.

## Why would this be relevant?
The number of smokers have been falling in the whole world, due to the fact the people tend to take more care about their health. Moreover, in some countries there are laws which forbid cigarettes and cigars in some environments. This would be the case for stadiums and bars in Brazil.
Therefore, this identification could help the authorities in charge to identify subjects who are not respecting the law and then follow the corresponding legal procedures.
