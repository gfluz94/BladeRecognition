# BladeRecognition
This project aims to build an object identification algorithm, based on YOLOv3 in DarkNet framework, which is able to identify knives. Why would this be relevant? Well, in the context of safety and security, such a system could make it possible for the identification of subjects who posses knives as weapons.
